Wow, this project. I really didn't feel like scrambling to decipher the author's code, so I came up with a simple solution: don't! I wrote the entire thing from scratch instead.
For better or for worse, I feel like I learned a TON. It was really fun, and while of course there were some bugs and long hours of bug-hunting, it honestly went way smoother than I predicted. 

The primary aspects of the project, that is, the adjacency list implementation and the actual algorithms went quite smoothly.


BUGS:
If you attempt to find all paths using a maximum weight that is smaller than any actual path weight, it will crash. 

The project is so complicated, and there are so many possible combos of commands, that I can't GUARANTEE that it is bug free. But I believe it mostly is.
